🚦 Traffy Timey

Traffy Timey is a traffic intelligence platform focused on one simple question:

When should I leave to reach my destination on time?

What It Does

Traffy Timey predicts travel time and suggests optimal departure times by learning from historical traffic patterns. Instead of reacting to congestion after it forms, the platform focuses on planning ahead.

How We’re Building It

We analyze recurring traffic behavior across routes and time slots to understand how congestion develops. Machine learning is used to estimate travel duration and recommend when users should start their journey.

Why It Matters

By shifting from reaction to prediction, Traffy Timey aims to reduce uncertainty and stress in daily commuting.

Status

Traffy Timey is currently under development.
We’ll be ready soon.
