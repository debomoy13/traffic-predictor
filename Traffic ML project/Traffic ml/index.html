    <h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>
  Urban traffic is unpredictable and stressful. We started Traffy Timey
  with a simple idea — people should know the best time to leave before
  they step out. By observing daily congestion patterns, we aim to turn
  uncertainty into informed decisions.
</p>

<p>
  Like many commuters, we experienced the frustration of leaving on time
  yet arriving late due to sudden traffic buildup. Existing navigation
  tools often react to traffic once you are already on the road, leaving
  little room to plan ahead.
</p>

<p>
  Traffy Timey was created to shift this mindset from reaction to
  preparation. By focusing on patterns rather than momentary conditions,
  we aim to help people make calmer, smarter travel choices — before
  their journey even begins.
</p>

    <h2>Our Solution</h2>
      <p>
        Traffy Timey analyzes historical traffic trends and time-based patterns
        to estimate how long a journey may take. Instead of reacting to traffic,
        our system helps users plan ahead and choose smarter departure times.
      </p>

      <p>
        Traffic conditions often follow repeatable patterns influenced by time
        of day, day of the week, and common commuting behaviors. By studying
        these recurring trends, Traffy Timey focuses on prediction rather than
        real-time reaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        This approach allows users to make informed decisions before leaving,
        reducing unnecessary delays and stress. Our goal is not just to show
        routes, but to provide clarity — helping people understand *when* to
        travel, not just *where*.
      </p>

    <h2>Upcoming Features</h2>
    <p>
      We are working towards route-level insights, city-specific optimization,
      and real-time adaptability. Future versions will integrate smarter
      predictions and broader coverage for urban commuters.
